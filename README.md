# 0.96-inch OLED Screen Display

A 0.96-inch OLED screen display is a compact, high-contrast display typically with a resolution of 128x64 pixels. 
It is often used in small electronics projects, like those involving microcontrollers, due to its low power 
consumption and ability to display sharp text and graphics. The display uses organic light-emitting diodes, which 
allow each pixel to emit its own light, resulting in bright, clear images without the need for a backlight.
